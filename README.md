1. What is this project about?
The project "When The Earth Is Shaking - 118 Years Of Earthquake" aims to take a deep look at the earthquake events happening all over the world since 1900. By integrating various types of visualization, many trends and interesting facts are shown to us. 

2. Who is the project for?
The target audience of my project can be anyone who seek to understand the history and trends of hundreds of years of earthquake events, who are interested in the causes and facts behind these events, as well as those who have experienced earthquakes themselves.

3. Why is the project being done?
Understanding both the earthquake itself and the causal relation between earthquakes and human behaviors, calendar years, geographic locations, etc. keeps us informed of what's happening with our natural environment.

4. What areas of your topic are you going to cover?
Looking at the changes of earthquake over the years. What are some countries that have experienced most earthquakes. Are there location similarities. 

5. What types of data are you going to look at?
The JSON file contains fields such as country, year, date and time, latitude and longitude, total deaths and injuries, etc.

6. What other information do you want to show?
Will look at the geographic patterns through Google Map API. The News API will also show us the latest news about earthquake happening right at the moment.
